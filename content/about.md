I'm **Hong Tao**, an electronics engineer from [GUET](https://www.guet.edu.cn/) (MW&RF). I code in my spare time and occasionally write. I'm from Guilin(Kweilin, KWL) and currently based in Guangzhou(Canton,CAN).

<br/>

I previously completed internships at an institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and a well-known intellectual property agency. I now work as an electronics engineer at a multinational company.

<br/>

I have experience in intellectual property and am the primary inventor on three computer software-related patents.

<br/>

I also work with electromagnetic simulation, with a focus on advancing digital simulation research in the life sciences (BioEM).

<br/>

On the scripting and software development side, I've found that large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted my productivity.
